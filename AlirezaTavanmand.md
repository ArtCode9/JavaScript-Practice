## 🔷suggestion for ( https://shahbazservice.com/ ) UI:
- i think we should make nav bar in two section
- upper on is for title of website
- and next section for nav bar with center align-item with defer ui
- and contact info and address is better go to the footer section
- and icon is better put in top left corner
- for the main section its better set grid responsive template
- for two reason one organize all content and two make it responsive
- work on text font size and family to make it easer read and pre style in html
- for footer is better make it align center and grid layout
- and for all element use padding , margin, display, position
- to make a smooth design
